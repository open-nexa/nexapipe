//! The shared secret an IPC client must present before the service obeys it.
//!
//! `ServiceRunner` listens on a loopback TCP port and runs elevated — SYSTEM on
//! Windows, root under systemd/launchd — while every IPC message is either
//! harmless (`GetStatus`) or drastic (`StartProxy` with `use_tun`, which takes
//! over routing and DNS). Nothing about a loopback socket identifies its peer,
//! so a message arriving here used to be obeyed on trust: **any** process the
//! user ran could ask the elevated service to rewrite that user's routing
//! table. The token is what replaces that trust.
//!
//! # Who owns the token
//!
//! The **UI process** holds it, not the service. That direction matters:
//!
//! * The token has to live somewhere both sides can read. Writing it into the
//!   user's own directory means the ordinary filesystem permissions already say
//!   the right thing — readable by that user plus the elevated accounts that
//!   can read anything anyway — whereas a file the service created would either
//!   be unreadable to the UI or readable to every other user.
//! * It also means the file appears when somebody actually runs the desktop
//!   app, and its absence is a meaningful answer: nobody has asked for the
//!   service yet, so nothing gets obeyed.
//!
//! The service therefore only ever *reads* it, and does so per connection so a
//! regenerated token takes effect without a restart.
