//! Virtual IP ↔ domain mapping for the TUN device.
//!
//! # Why a mapping and not the payload
//!
//! The tunnel used to send every connection to one virtual proxy address and
//! recover the destination from the payload: SNI out of a TLS `ClientHello`,
//! `Host` out of an HTTP request. That only works while the first bytes of a
//! connection are one of those two things, and it never worked for UDP at all —
//! a datagram to `10.0.1.3:3478` says nothing about whose traffic it is. A raw
//! TCP protocol (a database wire protocol, MQTT, a game) has no host name in it
//! either. And the port was never on the wire, so every flow looked like 443.
//!
//! So the DNS answers handed to the application carry a distinct address per
//! domain instead:
//!
//! ```text
//! dns.example.com   -> 10.0.1.16          (A)
//! dns.example.com   -> fd00:10:0:1::16    (AAAA)
//! ```
//!
//! The address is inside the TUN route (`10.0.1.0/24`, `fd00:10:0:1::/64`), so
//! the packets come back to us, and the reverse lookup answers "which domain" —
//! which is what picks the route on the server. The port is then carried by the
//! flow's own packet rather than guessed.
//!
//! # The address range
//!
//! IPv4: `.16` … `.254`. The addresses below `.16` belong to the Kotlin side of
//! the VPN: `.1` is the TUN interface, `.2` the DNS server the system resolver
//! points at, `.3` the legacy virtual proxy address.
//!
//! IPv6: `::16` … `::fffe` in the block the TUN holds, with `::1` left to the
//! interface for the same reason. Both ranges stay inside the routes the VPN
//! installs, so nothing has to be renegotiated with the platform when a domain
//! is resolved.
//!
//! # Two families, two pools
//!
//! A domain needs both an A and an AAAA answer — a resolver that got an empty
//! AAAA falls back to A, but one that got an address will try it — so one
//! domain holds one address per family, and a pool is per family: handing an
//! IPv4 address out of the IPv6 pool (or the other way round) is not possible,
//! and neither is evicting an address of one family to make room in the other.
