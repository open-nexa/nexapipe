//! A server-side allow-list of client public keys.
//!
//! The per-peer cap in [`super::limits`] answers *how much* a peer may open; 2FA
//! in [`super`] answers *who* a peer is; this answers *whether it may be here at
//! all*, and it is the only one of the three that runs before the QUIC handshake
//! has finished.
//!
//! Without it the Node ID is a reachability credential and nothing else is
//! checked: on a server started with `[auth] enabled = false` — which is the
//! default, and what `config.toml.example` ships — anybody who learns the Node
//! ID (or holds a ticket) completes the handshake and reaches every route. 2FA,
//! when it is on, closes that by demanding an HMAC over the connection's nonce
//! keyed with the client's secret, but it is a second factor the operator has to
//! turn on; this one is checked unconditionally when it is configured.
//!
//! The check lives in [`EndpointHooks::after_handshake`] rather than in the
//! accept loop, which buys one property worth stating: rejecting here happens
//! *before* [`iroh::endpoint::Endpoint::accept`] ever yields the connection, so a
//! refused peer never reaches `handle_incoming`, never takes a
//! [`super::limits::ConnectionLimiter`] slot and never gets a task. That is
//! strictly cheaper than any gate built on top of the accept, which is why the
//! comparison is not simply folded into `handle_incoming` where the other two
//! already are.
//!
//! `before_connect` is the wrong hook: it exists for *outgoing* connections and
//! is called from `Endpoint::connect`, so it can never see an inbound peer.
