//! Who is connected right now.
//!
//! The metrics module counts connections — how many, and over what kind of
//! path — but a count cannot answer "is *this* peer here", which is what the
//! management surface is asked. This is the other half: the set of peers being
//! served, with what is known about each.
//!
//! # Why a guard and not an explicit removal
//!
//! A connection ends in more ways than it has `return`s: the peer goes away,
//! a stream errors, the task is cancelled, authentication is refused. Each of
//! those would need its own removal call, and one missed would leave a peer
//! listed as connected forever. [`PeerGuard`] takes it out of the map on
//! `Drop` instead, the same way [`crate::shutdown::InFlightGuard`] reports a
//! connection as no longer in flight.
//!
//! # Why every connection is its own entry
//!
//! One peer can hold two connections at once: a reconnect that lands before the
//! connection it replaces has finished going away. Each gets an entry of its
//! own, with its own `connected_for`, because "how long has this one been open"
//! is a question about a connection and not about a peer. The alternative —
//! one entry per endpoint id, overwritten on the second `insert` — loses the
//! first connection the moment the second ends, listing a peer that is still
//! connected as no longer connected.
//!
//! Entries are still grouped by endpoint id, because that is what an operator
//! recognises: a Node ID they can compare against their client list.
//!
//! # How revocation reaches a connection that is already open
//!
//! Striking a credential out of `[auth]` must stop the traffic it is carrying
//! now, not only its next dial — otherwise removing a device changes what it
//! can do later and nothing else. Each entry therefore carries the sending half
//! of a [`tokio::sync::watch`] channel the connection task owns the other half
//! of: [`PeerRegistry::close_where`] flips it, and the task, which is the only
//! holder of the [`Connection`], is what actually closes.
//!
//! A signal rather than a connection handle, because owning the socket from two
//! places means either can close it and neither learns about it — and because a
//! `watch::Sender` can be created in a test without an endpoint to dial.
//! [`PeerRegistry::insert`] takes the sender, so nothing here knows or cares
//! how the task ends once told.
