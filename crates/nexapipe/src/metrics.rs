//! Instance metrics: what this process is doing, in Prometheus text format.
//!
//! # Why the format is written by hand
//!
//! The exposition format is a handful of lines per metric — `# HELP`, `# TYPE`,
//! then one `name{labels} value` per series — and everything behind it here is
//! an atomic integer. A registry crate would add a dependency, a `Cargo.lock`
//! change (CI builds with `--locked`) and an audit surface, to save the writing
//! of a `String`.
//!
//! # What is counted where
//!
//! Requests are recorded at the five places that answer one — three in
//! [`crate::conn`], two in [`crate::proxy`] — and **not** in
//! [`crate::log::log_access`], which looks like the one funnel but is not: the
//! L4 path calls it too, and what it counts there is a *flow*, a tunnel that
//! stays open for as long as the client wants, not a request. Mixing the two
//! would put long-lived flows in the same number as requests and leave both
//! unreadable, so flows have their own counter.
//!
//! Backend health is **not** instrumented at all. The pools already know the
//! answer, so it is read at exposition time from the live routing table; a
//! counter maintained by the probes could only drift from it.
//!
//! # Where bytes come from
//!
//! Bytes are counted on the **client leg** of every conversation and nowhere
//! else, which is the only place one number can mean one thing across paths
//! this different. `sent` is what reached a client, `received` is what a client
//! handed us.
//!
//! - **An HTTP response is not counted twice.** [`crate::http`] already counts
//!   what it delivered, because the access log prints it, and this module reads
//!   that number off the summary rather than looking at the wire again — two
//!   counts of one transfer are one count waiting to disagree with the other.
//!   What the summary carries includes the response head and any chunk framing,
//!   because that is what the client actually received.
//! - **A request is counted where it is assembled**: the head where it is
//!   parsed, the body once it has been read whole. One refused before its head
//!   finished is not counted, which is also what its access log line reports.
//! - **Tunnels** — TLS passthrough, L4 TCP, WebSocket after the handshake — are
//!   counted in [`crate::stream_util`], and a chunk is recorded only once it has
//!   left this process, so a write that failed reports nothing.
//! - **L4 UDP** keeps its own pair of loops and is counted there. Its framing is
//!   not: a datagram counts as its payload, the way every number here counts
//!   bytes an application would recognise.
//! - **The plaintext listener** records what it served and nothing else. It is a
//!   second entry point of a different shape, and `content-length` was always
//!   all it had.
//!
//! # One process, one set of counters
//!
//! These are process-wide by nature — there is one instance behind one set of
//! numbers — so they live in a `static` rather than being threaded through
//! every call that might want to record something. That is the same shape
//! [`crate::log`] uses for its access logger.
