/**
 * Seals the credentials this app keeps at rest: TOTP seeds, enrollment tokens
 * and the relay bearer token.
 *
 * The key lives in the Android keystore and never enters the process heap as
 * material, so reading the preferences file — from a backup, a rooted shell or
 * a pulled APK's private data — yields ciphertext that only this installation
 * can open. That is the property the keystore buys and a hard-coded key would
 * not: the app is not shipped with the means to decrypt its own storage.
 *
 * This replaces the `EncryptedSharedPreferences` of `androidx.security`, whose
 * API was deprecated in whole with 1.1.0 and which Google no longer publishes.
 *
 * Values are `AES-256-GCM` with a fresh 12-byte nonce per call, stored
 * alongside the ciphertext. GCM fails closed on tampering, so a corrupted
 * value surfaces as "no credential" rather than as a wrong one.
